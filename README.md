Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to design a game called Draw It or Lose It that could be played across several different operating platforms. They wanted a mobile device, such as
an app, that would be compatabile with different devices, allowing them to expand their product to meet the needs and wants of different potential users. The client asked to share
recommendations on different aspects of programming, such as memory and storage management, security, and which languages and programming tools to use. Other software requirements,
such as having the ability to have more than one team with each having multiple players, ensuring all the names are unique, and only one existence of the game in memory at a time,
had to have been considered to accomplish the client's goal.



What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

In developing the documentation for the Draw It or Lose It program, I thought I was able to effectively recommend a specific operating platform and throrougly provide information
as to why I felt that was the best platform for this specific use. I was able to provide reasoning as to why I believe Linux was the most appropriate operating system for The
Gaming Room client and give background information for the client who may not be as experienced or knowledgeable in this realm of application design. I was able to research
and provide information regarding the architecture, storage and memory management, distributed systems and networks, as well as security of the Linux operating platform, which 
overall helped me give an informed suggestion.



What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Documentation is an important step in working towards developing code for a program. Documentation allows you to think about the end product before working towards it, which 
leads to critical thinking of the steps needed to successfully accomplishing your goal. This can help a programmer avoid errors or obstacles that would otherwise be overlooked. 
I was able to think about what languages would work best for a specific operating platform, what IDE should be used, what functions would have to be designed to accomplish the
specific requirements and requests of the client, and any variables or parameters that would have to be defined. Giving oneself time to think before beginning work on the code
allows you to fully understand what is asked of you, making it easier to understand and accomplish the requirements.



If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If there is one part of the documentation that I would revise, I would choose to go back and improve my domain model. If I was able to, I would choose to do more research
on different design patterns, as well as how to understand and draw UML Diagrams. Although I felt I did a sufficient job on describing the relationships between different
classes and the attributes and methods in each class, I feel I would have been able to do a more thorough job explaining how they depend on each other and the different 
types of relationships each class had with one another. In addition, I think I would have been able to draw a more accurate or detailed UML Diagram for the Draw It or Lose
It program.



How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?


It is important to know, understand, and implement the user's needs and wants into the software design. The client hires or employs a programmer to create a product that
reflects their ideas, not our own. That's why it is important that as a programmer you ensure that you know what is being asked of you and do your best to accomplish all
that is expected of you. The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their product so that people on different operating platforms besides Android could use their 
application. Throughout my documentation, I included details on what would have to be done to make this possible and gave comparisons on the benefits and drawbacks of each
operating platform, such as using Mac, Linux, Windows, and mobile devices. Throughout my software design, I tried my best to use coding techniques that are universally
acceptable and understood, making it easier when it will eventually be used in other langauges or operating platforms. In addition, the user had several requests that
were implemented into the code. Some of these requests include the players being divided into teams, as well as only one game object being allowed in exisitence at a time.
By implementing the user's needs into my software design, I am ensuring I am correctly working towards the desired end product. 




How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
